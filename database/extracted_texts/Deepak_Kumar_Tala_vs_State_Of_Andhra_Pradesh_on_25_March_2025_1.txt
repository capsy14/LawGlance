                                  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1471 OF 2025

                                                   VERSUS
               STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH & ORS.                       …RESPONDENT(S)
                                                   ORDER
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal arises out of the order dated 18.11.2024 passed by the High Court in Criminal Appeal
No. 675/2024, dismissing the appeal against rejection of the appellant’s application for anticipatory
bail by Trial Court order dated 24.08.2024.
3. Briefly stated, the allegations in the FIR are as follows:
Respondent no. 3 (complainant) belongs to a Scheduled Caste. The appellant set up a
Trust for development of a temple along with respondent no. 3 and others, but forced
him to transfer certain lands. Upon refusal, the appellant threatened to kill him,
abused him by a caste slur, and asked him to stop reciting prayers. That on
18.04.2024, respondent no. 3 was abducted by various persons and taken to different
locations where he was kept locked up for several days. On 29.04.2024, some accused
persons took him to a petrol station and threatened him to transfer the temple’s
lands in the appellant’s name or that they would kill him. Upon refusing, they beat
respondent no. 3 with their hands and threatened him with small knives, which led
him to agree to transfer the lands out of fear. Meanwhile, respondent no. 3 was
rescued by the police and four accused persons were arrested.
4. FIR No. 69 of 2024 was lodged at P.S. G.D. Nellore UPS dated 18.04.2024 under Sections 364,
511, 307, 343, 419, 506, 120B, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 18601 and Sections 3(1)(r), 3(1)(s),Deepak Kumar Tala vs State Of Andhra Pradesh on 25 March, 2025

and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
2.
5. From a prima facie examination of the FIR, it is very clear that there is only one alleged instance
of an insult/caste slur but there is no allegation that such offending statement was made in the
presence of members of the general public. 3 Hence, an essential Hereinafter “IPC”.
2 Hereinafter “the SC/ST Act”.
3 See Swaran Singh v. State, (2008) 8 SCC 435, paras 28, 33; Hitesh Verma v. State of Uttarakhand,
(2020) 10 SCC 710, para 15; Ramesh Chandra Vaishya v. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2023 SCC OnLine
SC 668, para 17; Priti Agarwalla v. State of GNCT of Delhi, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 973, para 19.1;
Rabindra Kumar Chhattoi v. State of Odisha, SLP (Crl.) No 1608/2020 (order dt. 05.12.2024), para
13; Karuppudayar v. State, 2025 SCC OnLine SC 215, para 11.
ingredient for attracting Sections 2(1)(r) and 2(1)(s) of the SC/ST Act, i.e., that such statement must
be made within “public view”, as held by this Court in Shajan Skaria v. State of Kerala 4, is prima
facie not made out from the FIR. Further, an examination of the FIR also shows that the allegations
regarding the appellant’s involvement in the alleged conspiracy for respondent no. 3’s abduction
and criminal intimidation are only inferential in nature, which can be established during trial.
6. The relationship between the parties, as evident from the FIR itself is that the appellant and the
complainant were associated for a long time (since 2012) with the temple’s activities, for which a
Trust was formed that named both of them as trustees. It was only in 2017 that certain disputes
arose between them and multiple civil suits regarding the temple’s properties and funds were
instituted by the appellant.
7. In light of this overall perspective and considering the allegations in the FIR, our prima facie
conclusion is that the appellant is entitled to anticipatory bail as per the principles laid down by this
Court in Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India5 and Shajan Skaria (supra).
2024 SCC OnLine SC 2249.
(2020) 4 SCC 727, para 11.
8. In this view of the matter, by allowing the present appeal, we direct that in the event the appellant
is arrested in connection with FIR No. 69 of 2024 lodged at P.S. G.D. Nellore UPS dated 18.04.2024,
he shall be released on bail subject to such terms and conditions as the Trial Court may deem fit to
impose. We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter and
that the observations made in our order will have no bearing on the conduct of the trial or on the
final decision in the criminal proceedings.
9. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.Deepak Kumar Tala vs State Of Andhra Pradesh on 25 March, 2025
