3. Pursuant to the issuance of the above advertisement, an examination was conducted on 5th
November, 2017. Subsequently, respondent No. 4 issued a press release8 dated 9th November,
2017, stating that before the final panel of selected candidates is prepared, the candidates would be
required to remain present in the District Establishment Section, Palamu for the purpose of
counselling. Upon completion of the counselling process, the District Education Officer9 vide office
order10 dated 9th March, 9 Hereinafter, referred to as “respondent no. 5”. 10 Memo no. 399.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 2018, issued appointment letter to the successful
candidates, including the appellant herein. Meanwhile, an FIR11 came to be registered at Police
Station Daltonganj Town, District Palamu alleging rampant corruption and mass scale cheating in
the examination conducted for the subject posts on 5th November, 2017.
4. Aggrieved by the publication of the list of successful candidates, some non-selected candidates
preferred writ petitions12 before the High Court which came to be allowed vide order dated 12th
September, 2018, directing the respondent-State to prepare a fresh merit list as per the marks
obtained in the written examination conducted on 5th November, 2017, without counting the marks
awarded to the candidates in interview. The learned Single Judge opined that the appointment was
not carried out in accordance with the stipulations made in the advertisement dated 29th July,
2010, as there was admittedly, no provision for interview in the advertisement which was conducted
by the respondent-State. The learned Single Judge further observed that the respondent-State had
acted de hors the rules and regulations 12 Supra note 3.

cumulative marks obtained by the candidates in written examination as well as the interview.Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025

5. Aggrieved, the respondent-State preferred an intra-court appeal13 assailing the aforesaid order of
the learned Single Judge. The Division Bench vide first impugned order dated 7th November, 2019,
dismissed the appeal and upheld the order dated 12th September, 2018, passed by the learned
Single Judge. Pursuant to the aforesaid direction of learned Single Judge, respondent No. 5 vide
office order dated 7th December, 2020, relieved the appellant-employee and other candidates who
were purportedly selected de hors the rules and terminated their service.
6. The appellant-employee and other similarly aggrieved candidates assailed their termination order
by preferring writ petitions14 before the High Court seeking issuance of a writ to reinstate them in
service. The learned Single Judge vide order dated 9th March, 2022, dismissed the batch of writ
petitions, holding that no case for interference was made out as admittedly, the respondent-State
had changed the rules of the game by 14 Supra note 5.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 introducing the interview round in the selection process
after the ball had been set rolling. The learned Single Judge further held that the respondent-State
had prepared the fresh panel of selected candidates in compliance with the direction of the High
Court in WP (S) No. 6709 of 2017 and other analogous petitions15, which stood affirmed in the first
impugned order and hence, the termination orders were valid in the eyes of law.
7. Aggrieved, the appellant-employee and other similarly situated candidates preferred a batch of
intra-court appeals16 assailing the order dated 9th March, 2022, passed by the learned Single
Judge. The learned Division Bench, vide order dated 24th November, 2022, dismissed these appeals
and held that as the decision with respect to preparation of fresh panel of selected candidates had
attained finality in view of the judgment of the Coordinate Bench, the respondent-State was justified
in issuing the order terminating the services of the appellant-employee and other similarly situated
candidates for being less meritorious. 15 Supra note 3.

Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
8. Aggrieved, the appellant-employee has approached this Court by way of these appeals by special
leave assailing the impugned orders passed by the learned Division Bench of the High Court.
Submissions on behalf of the appellant-employee: -
9. Learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant-employee strenuously contended that the
appellant-employee was duly selected and has been appointed to the subject posts, purely on merit,
vide Memorandum No. 399 dated 9th March, 2018, issued by the competent authority. There was
no allegation of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the appellant-employee while seeking the
appointment on the post in question.
10. It was submitted that pursuant to the valid appointment of the appellant-employee, he has
satisfactorily served the respondent-State for two and a half years and has also completed his
probation period. Further, the learned counsel urged that as the appellant-employee has becomeAmrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 5

over-age for other Government jobs, a sympathetic view ought to be taken by setting aside the
termination order dated 7th December, 2020 issued by respondent No. 5.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
11. He further contended that the Division Bench grossly erred in issuing a direction to the
respondent-State to prepare a fresh panel of selected candidates without impleading the affected
persons, such as the appellant-employee, as a party in the proceedings and thus, violated the
principles of natural justice. The non-selected candidates who had filed the writ petitions had
voluntarily refrained from appearing in the counselling process, and hence, they lacked locus to
challenge the recruitment process.
12. Learned counsel concluded his submissions by imploring this Court to take a sympathetic view
and to accept the appeals, set aside the impugned judgments, quash the termination order dated 7th
December, 2020, and direct the respondent-State to reinstate the appellant-employee in service.
Submissions on behalf of the respondent-State: -
13. Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-State contended that the
impugned judgments do not suffer from any infirmity or illegality. He contended that the fresh
panel of selected candidates, was prepared by the respondent- State in compliance with the
direction of the High Court vide order dated 12th September, 2018. Once the appointment of the
appellant-employee was found to be de hors the law, he cannot Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of
2024 claim a preferential right of continuing in service as against the candidates who were
admittedly higher in merit.
14. Learned standing counsel further contended that the case of the appellant-employee suffers from
gross delay which remains unexplained as he is laying challenge to judgment17 of the Division
Bench dated 7th November, 2019 after a period of more than 3 years. As such, the
appellant-employee is not entitled to any relief. On these grounds, the learned Counsel for the
respondent-State implored this Court to dismiss the appeals and affirm the impugned judgments.
Issues: -
15. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at bar and have
carefully gone through the impugned judgments and the material placed on record.
16. The core issues presented for adjudication before this Court in these appeals are: -
(1) Whether the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010 issued by respondent No. 4 and
appointment process carried out in pursuance thereof, was valid in the eyes of law?
17 First impugned order.Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 6

Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 (2) Whether the direction issued by the High Court vide
order dated 12th September, 2018 was justified considering the fact that the candidates earlier
appointed to the subject posts were neither impleaded as party nor were heard before the issuance
of a direction that adversely affected their service?
Discussion and Analysis: -
Issue No. 1: Whether the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010 by respondent No. 4
and appointment process carried out in pursuance thereof was valid in the eyes of
law?
17. To adjudge the validity of the recruitment process and the appointments made
thereunder for the subject posts, we deem it fit to consider the terms and conditions
of the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, issued by respondent No. 4 on the
touchstone of the precedents of this Court so as to find out whether the same was in
conformity with law or not.
18. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Renu v. District and Sessions Judge, Tis
Hazari Courts, Delhi,18 discussed in detail the requirements of a valid advertisement
and observed thus:-
18 (2014) 14 SCC 50.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 “16. Another important requirement of public appointment
is that of transparency. Therefore, the advertisement must specify the number of posts available for
selection and recruitment. The qualifications and other eligibility criteria for such posts should be
explicitly provided and the schedule of recruitment process should be published with certainty and
clarity. The advertisement should also specify the rules under which the selection is to be made and
in absence of the rules, the procedure under which the selection is likely to be undertaken. This is
necessary to prevent arbitrariness and to avoid change of criteria of selection after the selection
process is commenced, thereby unjustly benefiting someone at the cost of others.” (emphasis
supplied)
19. Thus, the advertisements which fail to mention the number of posts available for selection are
invalid and illegal due to lack of transparency. This Court further expounded in Renu(supra) that
any appointment in violation of the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India is not
only irregular but also illegal and cannot be sustained. It is a trite law that a valid advertisement
inviting applications for public employment must include the total number of seats, the ratio of
reserved and unreserved seats, minimum qualification for the posts and procedural clarity with
respect to the type and manner of selection stages, i.e., written, oral examination and interviews.
20. Further, the position of law is settled that though there is no fundamental right to claim
reservation as Articles 16(4) and (4-A) of the Constitution of India are in the nature of enabling
provisions only and do not mandate the State or its instrumentalities to Civil Appeal No(s).Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 7

13950-13951 of 2024 provide reservation in every selection process but inspite thereof, the State’s
decision to not provide reservation has to be based on some quantifiable data and valid reasoning.
21. Reference in this regard may be made to this Court’s decision in Mukesh Kumar v. State of
Uttarakhand,19 wherein, it was held that:-
“12. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) do not confer fundamental right to claim reservations
in promotion [Ajit Singh (2) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209]. By relying upon
earlier judgments of this Court, it was held in Ajit Singh (2) [Ajit Singh (2) v. State of
Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209] that Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) are in the nature of
enabling provisions, vesting a discretion on the State Government to consider
providing reservations, if the circumstances so warrant. It is settled law that the State
Government cannot be directed to provide reservations for appointment in public
posts [C.A. Rajendran v. Union of India, AIR 1968 SC 507]. Similarly, the State is not
bound to make reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of
promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion and make such
provision, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation of that class in public services. If the decision of the State Government
to provide reservations in promotion is challenged, the State concerned shall have to
place before the Court the requisite quantifiable data and satisfy the Court that such
reservations became necessary on account of inadequacy of representation of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a particular class or classes of posts
without affecting general efficiency of administration as mandated by Article 335 of
the Constitution.
[M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212]
13. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) empower the State to make reservation in matters of appointment and
promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes “if in the opinion of the State
they are not adequately represented in the services of the State”. It is for the State Government to
decide whether reservations are required in the matter of appointment and promotions to public
posts. The language 19 (2020) 3 SCC 1.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 in clauses (4) and (4-A) of Article 16 is clear, according to
which, the inadequacy of representation is a matter within the subjective satisfaction of the State.
The State can form its own opinion on the basis of the material it has in its possession already or it
may gather such material through a Commission/ Committee, person or authority. All that is
required is that there must be some material on the basis of which the opinion is formed. The Court
should show due deference to the opinion of the State which does not, however, mean that the
opinion formed is beyond judicial scrutiny altogether. The scope and reach of judicial scrutiny in
matters within the subjective satisfaction of the executive are extensively stated in Barium
Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board [Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board, AIR 1967
SC 295], which need not be reiterated. [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217]”
(emphasis supplied)Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 8

22. Thus, it is imperative that the State must specifically mention in the advertisement the total
number of reserved and unreserved seats. However, if the State does not intend to provide
reservation, in view of the quantifiable data indicating adequacy of representation, this aspect must
also be specifically mentioned in the advertisement.
23. In the present case, the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, issued by respondent No. 4 is
completely silent on the aspect of total number of posts and the number of reserved quota and
general quota posts. We are of the view that if the State chooses not to provide reservation, that
decision must also be conveyed through the advertisement along with the afore-mentioned lists of
inclusions. This Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
Umadevi,20 observed that any appointment made in violation of the statutory rules as well as the
mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution would be a nullity in law.
24. In the wake of the afore-mentioned judicial precedents, we are of the view that the entire
recruitment process initiated for the subject posts, in furtherance of the advertisement dated 29th
July, 2010, is in violation of both the legal precedents and settled law. Therefore, we hold that the
advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, issued by respondent No. 4 was not a valid advertisement
inviting applications for public employment and is thus, a nullity in law. Issue No. 2: Whether the
direction issued by the High Court vide order dated 12th September, 2018, was justified considering
the fact that the candidates earlier appointed to the subject posts were neither impleaded as party
nor were heard before the issuance of a direction that adversely affected their service?
25. Before answering this issue, we deem it fit to discuss the background of this case. The
respondent-State had issued the advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, in complete disregard to the
20 (2006) 4 SCC 1.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 precedents of this Court as well as in sheer contravention
of the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India as discussed in the first issue. In
pursuance of this advertisement, the respondent-State has carried out the entire recruitment
process. The limited ground of challenge in the legal proceedings from which the first impugned
order emanates was that the petitioners therein had pleaded foul-play on the part of the
respondent-State, and contended that the rules of the game had been changed by respondent-State
by awarding marks to some candidates in the interview round. The High Court in this regard was
justified in ordering preparation of a fresh panel of selected candidates on the basis of the marks
secured in the written examination, conducted on 5th November, 2017. This decision has been
upheld by the Division Bench in the first impugned order dated 7th November, 2019 which has now
attained finality as no further challenge thereto was laid by either the respondent-State or the
appellant-employee at that time.
26. Subsequently, the respondent-State prepared fresh panel of selected candidates. However, the
name of the appellant-employee was not included in the fresh panel, for being lower in merit and his
services were terminated by order dated 7th December, 2020. It Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of
2024 is then that fresh writ petitions21 came to be preferred by the appellant-employee and other
similarly situated candidates laying challenge to order whereby their services were terminated. InAmrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 9

our view, the appellant-employee was precluded from invoking the jurisdiction of the learned Single
Judge who could not have interfered with the decision which had attained finality after being upheld
by the Division Bench in the first impugned order. Until and unless, a review petition was filed
against the first impugned order, it provided finality with respect to the present advertisement.
27. Hence, the learned Single Judge rightly dismissed the writ petitions filed by the
appellant-employee and other similarly situated candidates against their termination order. No
error whatsoever was committed by the learned Division Bench in dismissing the appeal as it had
clearly stated that the appellants therein failed to lay challenge to the decision of the Coordinate
Bench in the first impugned order dated 7th November, 2019. The Division Bench in a fresh round
of litigation could not have 21 Supra note 5.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 reviewed the orders passed by a Coordinate Bench in
relation to the same controversy.
28. It is before this Court, for the first time, that the appellant- employee has laid challenge to the
first impugned order dated 7th November, 2019, thus, the only controversy that demands our
attention is whether the Division Bench was correct in directing the respondent-State to prepare
fresh panel of selected candidates without giving an opportunity of hearing to the candidates who
were likely to get affected by such direction.
29. The position of law is crystallized on the aspect of compliance with the principles of natural
justice in both administrative spheres as well as judicial decisions. It is trite law that the principles
of natural justice cannot be applied in any straitjacket formula and it is imperative to understand
that there are certain exceptions to their applicability. Reference in this regard may be made to the
decision of this Court in Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. v. CCE,22 wherein it was held thus: -
“38. But that is not the end of the matter. While the law on the principle of audi
alteram partem has progressed in the manner mentioned above, at the same time,
the courts have also repeatedly remarked that the principles of natural justice are
very flexible principles. They cannot be applied in any straitjacket formula. It all
depends upon the 22 (2015) 8 SCC 519.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 kind of functions performed and to the extent to which a
person is likely to be affected. For this reason, certain exceptions to the aforesaid principles have
been invoked under certain circumstances. For example, the courts have held that it would be
sufficient to allow a person to make a representation and oral hearing may not be necessary in all
cases, though in some matters, depending upon the nature of the case, not only full-fledged oral
hearing but even cross-examination of witnesses is treated as a necessary concomitant of the
principles of natural justice. Likewise, in service matters relating to major punishment by way of
disciplinary action, the requirement is very strict and full-fledged opportunity is envisaged under
the statutory rules as well. On the other hand, in those cases where there is an admission of charge,
even when no such formal inquiry is held, the punishment based on such admission is upheld. It is
for this reason, in certain circumstances, even post-decisional hearing is held to be permissible.Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 10

Further, the courts have held that under certain circumstances principles of natural justice may even
be excluded by reason of diverse factors like time, place, the apprehended danger and so on. …
40. In this behalf, we need to notice one other exception which has been carved out to the aforesaid
principle by the courts. Even if it is found by the court that there is a violation of principles of
natural justice, the courts have held that it may not be necessary to strike down the action and refer
the matter back to the authorities to take fresh decision after complying with the procedural
requirement in those cases where non-grant of hearing has not caused any prejudice to the person
against whom the action is taken. Therefore, every violation of a facet of natural justice may not lead
to the conclusion that the order passed is always null and void. The validity of the order has to be
decided on the touchstone of “prejudice”. The ultimate test is always the same viz. the test of
prejudice or the test of fair hearing.” (emphasis supplied)
30. In the present case, the Division Bench in the first impugned order dated 7th November, 2019,
had confirmed the directions passed by the learned Single Judge to the respondent-State to prepare
a fresh panel of selected candidates without affording any Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
opportunity of hearing to the candidates, who were earlier declared successful by the
respondent-State and were holding the subject posts. Subsequently, the respondent-State relieved
the appellant- employee and other candidates selected de hors the rules and terminated their
services vide order dated 7th December, 2020.
31. In our view, since the very selection and appointment of the appellant-employee was a nullity in
the eyes of law, the learned Single Judge committed no error in directing the respondent-State to
prepare fresh panel of selected candidates without hearing the candidates who were likely to get
affected. In this regard, we are benefitted by the decision of this Court in Union of India v.
Raghuwar Pal Singh,23 wherein, it was held that when the appointment of the candidates is a nullity
in law making them disentitled to hold the posts, the principles of natural justice were not required
to be complied with, particularly when the same would be nothing short of an exercise in futility.
The relevant portion is extracted hereinbelow: -
“20. For taking this contention forward, we may assume, for the time being, that the
then Director Incharge H.S. Rathore, Agriculture Officer had the authority to issue a
letter of appointment. Nevertheless, he could do so only upon obtaining prior written
approval of the competent authority. No case has been made out in the original
application that due approval was 23 (2018) 15 SCC 463.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 granted by the competent authority before issuance of the
letter of appointment to the respondent. Thus, it is indisputable that no prior approval of the
competent authority was given for the appointment of the respondent. In such a case, the next
logical issue that arises for consideration is : whether the appointment letter issued to the
respondent, would be a case of nullity or a mere irregularity? If it is a case of nullity, affording
opportunity to the incumbent would be a mere formality and non-grant of opportunity may not
vitiate the final decision of termination of his services. The Tribunal has rightly held that in absence
of prior approval of the competent authority, the Director Incharge could not have hastenedAmrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 11

issuance of the appointment letter. The act of commission and omission of the then Director
Incharge would, therefore, suffer from the vice of lack of authority and nullity in law.
…
23. In State of Manipur [State of Manipur v. Y. Token Singh, (2007) 5 SCC 65 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S)
107] , the appointment letters were cancelled on the ground that the same were issued without the
knowledge of the department of the State. The Court after adverting to the reported decisions
concluded that the candidates were not entitled to hold the posts and in a case of such nature,
principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with, particularly when the same
would result in futility. …” (emphasis supplied)
32. Hence, in view of the above principle and the factual scenario in the case at hand, it is clear that
if the subject appointments were ab-initio nullity in the eyes of law, it was not incumbent on the
learned Single Judge to pass the order after hearing all the parties that were likely to be affected by
such decision, i.e., the candidates who were already appointed on the subject posts including the
appellant-employee.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
33. Therefore, we are of the view that the learned Single Judge did not commit any error while
issuing a direction vide order dated 12th September, 2018, for preparation of fresh panel of selected
candidates in consonance with the statutory rules and procedure prescribed in the advertisement as
it is clearly discernible from our discussion in the first issue that the recruitment process was void
ab-initio and ultra vires the Constitution of India. Therefore, there was no need to comply with the
principles of natural justice as that would be nothing, but an exercise in futility and the appellant-
employee thus, cannot be allowed to claim prejudice from the fact that he was neither impleaded
nor heard before the issuance of a direction affecting his service.
34. With respect to the power of cancellation of the entire selection process, this Court in M.P. State
Coop. Bank Ltd. v. Nanuram Yadav,24 held thus:-
“24. It is clear that in the matter of public appointments, the following principles are
to be followed:
(1) The appointments made without following the appropriate procedure under the
rules/government circulars and without advertisement or inviting applications from
the open market would amount to breach of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India.
(2) Regularisation cannot be a mode of appointment.
24 (2007) 8 SCC 264.Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 12

Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 (3) An appointment made in violation of the mandatory
provisions of the statute and in particular, ignoring the minimum educational qualification and
other essential qualification would be wholly illegal. Such illegality cannot be cured by taking
recourse to regularisation. (4) Those who come by back door should go through that door. (5) No
regularisation is permissible in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Article 162 of the
Constitution of India if the appointments have been made in contravention of the statutory rules.
(6) The court should not exercise its jurisdiction on misplaced sympathy.
(7) If the mischief played is so widespread and all pervasive, affecting the result, so as to make it
difficult to pick out the persons who have been unlawfully benefited or wrongfully deprived of their
selection, it will neither be possible nor necessary to issue individual show-cause notice to each
selectee. The only way out would be to cancel the whole selection.
(8) When the entire selection is stinking, conceived in fraud and delivered in deceit, individual
innocence has no place and the entire selection has to be set aside.” (emphasis supplied)
35. Thus, it is clear that once the appointment process is declared to be a nullity in law, every action
taken in furtherance of such appointment process is also illegal, and, therefore, the constitutional
courts have jurisdiction to set aside such appointments wholly and ab-initio. This power of the Court
is not curtailed even in a situation where a third-party right has been created in those who have been
offered appointment or have even joined the service.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024
36. This Court in State of U.P. v. U.P. State Law Officers’ Assn.,25 while dealing with the back-door
entries in public appointment observed as under: -
“19. … The appointments may, therefore, be made on considerations other than merit
and there exists no provision to prevent such appointments. The method of
appointment is indeed not calculated to ensure that the meritorious alone will always
be appointed or that the appointments made will not be on considerations other than
merit. In the absence of guidelines, the appointments may be made purely on
personal or political considerations, and be arbitrary. This being so those who come
to be appointed by such arbitrary procedure can hardly complain if the termination
of their appointment is equally arbitrary. Those who come by the back door have to
go by the same door. This is more so when the order of appointment itself stipulates
that the appointment is terminable at any time without assigning any reason. Such
appointments are made, accepted and understood by both sides to be purely
professional engagements till they last. The fact that they are made by public bodies
cannot vest them with additional sanctity. Every appointment made to a public office,
howsoever made, is not necessarily vested with public sanctity. There is, therefore, no
public interest involved in saving all appointments irrespective of their mode. From
the inception some engagements and contracts may be the product of the operationAmrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 13

of the spoils system. There need be no legal anxiety to save them.” (emphasis
supplied)
37. It is, therefore, clear that a beneficiary of a back-door procedure cannot claim proper treatment
as per law when they come at the receiving end.
38. In the present case, the appellant-employee, who had been appointed under the advertisement
dated 29th July, 2010, does not have any right on the subject posts once it is concluded that the 25
(1994) 2 SCC 204.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 advertisement is itself void and is declared illegal and
unconstitutional. The candidates’ right to continue on such posts is contingent upon the legality of
the advertisement and the recruitment process conducted in pursuance thereof.
39. At this juncture, before parting, we deem it fit to note that public employment is a duty
entrusted by the Constitution of India with the State. Therefore, it becomes imperative that the
rigours of Articles 14 and 16 are not ignored by the State in relation to the matter concerning public
employment. Arbitrariness in public employment goes to the very root of the fundamental right to
equality. While no person can claim a fundamental right to appointment, it does not mean that the
State can be allowed to act in an arbitrary or capricious manner. The State is accountable to the
public at large as well as the Constitution of India, which guarantees equal and fair treatment to
each person. Public employment process thus, must always be fair, transparent, impartial and
within the bounds of the Constitution of India. Every citizen has a fundamental right to be treated
fairly and impartially, which is an appendage of right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution
of India. A violation of this guarantee is liable to judicial scrutiny as well as criticism.
Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 Conclusion: -
40. In view of the peculiar facts of this case and discussion made hereinabove, we do not deem it fit
to delve into the observations made in the impugned judgments as the subject matter dealt therein
is different. The question with respect to the illegality of the recruitment process was not raised in
any of the proceedings before the Courts below. On the other hand, it was here, for the first time,
before this Court, that the appellant-employee have laid challenge to the first impugned order.
41. Resultantly, the appeals stand disposed of with the following directions: -
i. The advertisement dated 29th July, 2010, issued by respondent No. 4 and all the
consequential proceedings conducted in pursuance thereof are hereby quashed for
being violative of Articles 14 and 16 and judicial precedents of this Court.
ii. All the appointments made in furtherance of the direction of the High Court dated
12th September, 2018, with respect to the subject posts are quashed.Amrit Yadav vs The State Of Jharkhand on 10 February, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/63744191/ 14

iii. The respondent-State shall issue a fresh advertisement, compliant with the
constitutional mandate and in Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 accordance
with the extant Rules and the observations made hereinabove. Thereafter, the
recruitment process shall be re-conducted in accordance with law for the subject
posts.
iv. In the interest of justice, we direct that the fresh notification shall be issued in
terms of our direction(supra) within six months from today and will specifically
provide suitable age relaxation in order to accommodate all such aspirants, who
would have in the supervening period and during the pendency of the present
litigation crossed the age limit for selection on the subject posts.
42. Parties are directed to bear their own costs.
43. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. CIVIL APPEALS NO(S). 13952 OF 2024
CIVIL APPEALS NO(S). 13953 OF 2024 CIVIL APPEALS NO(S). 13954 OF 2024 CIVIL APPEALS
NO(S). 13955 OF 2024
44. In these appeals, the appellants have laid challenge only to the second impugned order of the
High Court dated 24th November, 2022. As we have quashed the advertisement dated 29th July,
2010 and the consequential selection process thereto in Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024,
the question involved in Civil Appeal No(s). 13950-13951 of 2024 these appeals has become
academic and therefore, does not merit our interference.
45. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
46. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
