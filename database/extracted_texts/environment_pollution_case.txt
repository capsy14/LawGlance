PETITIONER: GREEN EARTH FOUNDATION (NGO)

Vs. APEX MANUFACTURING LTD. & STATE POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 11/03/2007

BENCH: S.H. Kapadia, A.R. Lakshmanan

ACTS INVOLVED: Environment Protection Act, 1986 Water (Prevention &
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 Constitution of India — Articles 21,
48A, 51A(g)

HEADNOTE: Environmental pollution — industrial hazardous discharge —
contamination of groundwater — failure of State Pollution Control Board
to regulate — right to clean drinking water as part of Article 21 —
strict liability for industrial units.

Apex Manufacturing Ltd., a chemical dye producer, was alleged to have
released untreated effluents into the Lakshmi River for over 18 months,
causing severe contamination of groundwater. Villagers reported skin
diseases, livestock deaths, and foul smell from borewells.

The NGO filed a writ petition alleging: 1. Pollution Control Board
conducted inspections only on paper. 2. Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)
was non-functional for months. 3. No emergency action was taken despite
repeated complaints. 4. State authorities colluded with the industry.

The High Court dismissed the petition citing “lack of technical data.”
Supreme Court disagreed, holding that burden of proof shifts to polluter
once contamination is shown.

JUDGMENT: 1. Independent lab reports confirmed toxic dyes and metals
above permissible limits. 2. Pollution Control Board failed to produce
inspection logs. 3. Industry could not explain why ETP inactive for 142
days. 4. Right to clean water is integral to Article 21. 5.
Precautionary and Polluter Pays principles apply.

ORDER: - Apex Manufacturing Ltd. fined ₹18 crore for environmental
restoration. - Operations shut until ETP remains functional for 60
consecutive days. - ₹3 lakh compensation to each affected family. -
Pollution Control Board to overhaul inspection mechanism within 90
days. - Monitoring committee formed under retired High Court judge.
