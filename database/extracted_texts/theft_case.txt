Equivalent citations: 1981 AIR 1672, 1981 SCR (2) 540, AIR 1981 SUPREME
COURT 1672

PETITIONER: MAHESH KUMAR

Vs. STATE OF RAJASTHAN

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 21/10/1981

BENCH: O. Chinnappa Reddy, S. Murtaza Fazal Ali

ACT: Indian Penal Code — Sections 378, 379 — burden of proof in theft —
recovery evidence — hostile witnesses.

HEADNOTE: Theft case — electrical copper coils stolen from government
power warehouse — prosecution relied solely on recovery of items
allegedly buried behind accused’s house — hostile panch witnesses — no
eyewitness — suspicious delay in filing FIR — chain of custody not
maintained.

According to prosecution, 84 kg of copper wire was stolen on the night
of 14 May 1979. Warehouse guard noticed the break‑in only next morning,
but lodged FIR after 20 hours, attributing delay to “seeking permission
from senior officer.”

Two neighbours were cited as witnesses claiming they saw accused near
warehouse, but both denied this during trial. Recovery of coils was made
from an open plot behind accused’s house, accessible to public, with no
exclusive control. Forensic matching was inconclusive.

JUDGMENT: 1. Conviction cannot rely solely on recovery from open area.
2. Hostile witnesses weaken prosecution case completely. 3. FIR delay
and lack of corroboration create reasonable doubt. 4. Possibility of
false implication cannot be ruled out.

ORDER: Appeal allowed. Conviction set aside. Petitioner acquitted.
