Equivalent citations: 2003 AIR 3127, 2003 5 SCR 908, (2003) 8 SCC 440

PETITIONER: R.K. MALHOTRA

Vs. UNION OF INDIA

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 17/08/2003

BENCH: Y.K. Sabharwal, Arijit Pasayat

ACT: IPC Sections 420, 467, 468; Prevention of Corruption Act —
fraudulent loans — forged documents — admissibility of confessional
statements.

HEADNOTE: Bank fraud — petitioner, a senior branch manager, accused of
sanctioning ₹2.4 crore in unsecured loans to shell companies.
Prosecution alleged that balance sheets were forged and companies had no
operational existence. Confessional note obtained during departmental
inquiry was treated as primary evidence.

Supreme Court held that confession extracted under threat of losing
employment is inadmissible under law. Forensic handwriting report did
not conclusively prove petitioner’s involvement. Audit reports showed
collective responsibility, not individual liability. No recovery of
alleged kickbacks.

JUDGMENT: 1. Confession during departmental inquiry cannot be treated as
voluntary. 2. No direct evidence linking petitioner to creation of
forged documents. 3. Investigation failed to trace money trail. 4.
Criminal prosecution cannot rely on assumptions.

ORDER: Criminal conviction set aside. Department may pursue
administrative penalties separately.
