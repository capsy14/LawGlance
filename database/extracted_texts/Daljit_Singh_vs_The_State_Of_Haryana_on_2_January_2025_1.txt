SANJAY KAROL, J.
1. The questions arising in this appeal that assails the judgment and order dated 2nd June, 2023
passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in Case No.CRM-M-5784 of 2023
(O&M), whereby under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code, 19731 the Court refused to quash
Complaint Case No.151 of 2010 dated 8th June, 2010; summoning order dated 17th August, 2010;
and order dated 28th November, 2016 declaring the appellant a proclaimed offender passed by the
Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Bhiwani; are that whether the proclaimed offender status, under the
provisions of the Cr.P.C., of an accused can subsist if such accused stands acquitted during trial in
connection to the very Hereinafter, “Cr.P.C.” same offence; and whether the subsistence of the
proclamation under Section 82 of Cr.P.C. is necessary for the authorities to proceed against an
accused against whom such a proclamation stands issued, under Section 174A of the Indian Penal
Code, 18602.
2. The facts which gave rise to the question as above, in brief, are:
2.1 The Appellant ran a business concern which was awarded a contract for
‘8-Laning’ of a National Highway (NH-1) within Delhi, by the National Highways
Authority of India3.Daljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025

2.2 In furtherance of such a contract, Respondent No. 24 approached a company by
the name of M/s Bhola Singh Jaiprakash Construction Ltd. for stone crushing. On
mutually agreed specifications, it is also part of the agreement that the same would be
supplied to the construction site. In connection thereto, cheques by way of security,
were also issued. The work under the agreement was also executed but allegedly did
not meet the specifications, hence resulting in a dispute.
2.3 The NHAI terminated the Appellant’s contract on 13th January, 2009 and
accordingly cashed the bank guarantee furnished. It is alleged that the cheques issued
by way of security to Respondent No. 2 were misplaced and the new cheque worth
10 Lacs given as the payment was duly encashed on 16th October, 2009.5
Subsequently on 30th November, 2009 cheque issued Hereinafter, “IPC” Hereafter,
“NHAI” Hereinafter referred to as the complainant Cheque No. 72107, Bank of
Baroda.
from the bank guarantee account as security was also encashed despite having encashed the
subsequent cheque issued as final payment. 2.4 The Complaint case, in connection with the
unclaimed cheque, was filed on 8th June, 2010, in which summons were issued on 17th August,
2010. Thereafter, the case was allegedly transferred out of Bhiwani, and eventually back to its
jurisdictional Court. Notice upon non-appearance of the Appellant, direction to issue written
proclamation under Section 82 Cr.P.C. with a further direction to the Appellant to appear before the
Court on 28th November, 2016 was issued on 15th October, 2016. On 28th November, 2016, the
order declaring the Appellant and another director of the company as proclaimed offenders, was
issued6. All such proceedings and orders are subject matter of challenge in this Appeal.
2.5 This other Director, RP Singh preferred quashing petitions before the High Court which came to
be eventually dismissed. 2.6 The Appellant was arrested under the PO Order on 19 th December,
2022 and released on bail the same day, by the competent Court. He was raided by the police again,
in connection with an FIR7 of similar nature. 2.7 The Quashing Petition in which the impugned
order came to be passed was filed on 31st January, 2023. The same was dismissed on 2nd June,
2023 by the impugned order and judgment.
Hereafter referred to as the ‘PO Order’ FIR No. 200 dated 17th December 2023 u/s 174A, IPC.
3. The impugned order dismissed the Appellant's petition under Section 482, Cr.P.C., with reference
to an earlier judgment of the Court wherein it had been held that if a person had been declared a
proclaimed offender, such a petition by him would not be maintainable. It was observed that the
validity of such a proclamation is also to be raised before the Court which issued the proclamation.
4. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. It is the admitted position at the Bar
that in subsequent developments after the filing of the special leave petition, the Appellant stands
exonerated in the germane proceedings under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
It is against this backdrop that the questions identified in paragraph 1 of this judgment, arise for
consideration.Daljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025

5. Section 82 of the Cr.P.C. runs thus:
“82. Proclamation for person absconding.—(1) If any Court has reason to believe
(whether after taking evidence or not) that any person against whom a warrant has
been issued by it has absconded or is concealing himself so that such warrant cannot
be executed, such Court may publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear
at a specified place and at a specified time not less than thirty days from the date of
publishing such proclamation.
(2) The proclamation shall be published as follows:—
(i) (a) it shall be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village in
which such person ordinarily resides;
(b) it shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which
such person ordinarily resides or to some conspicuous place of such town or village;
(c) a copy thereof shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the Court-house;
(ii) the Court may also, if it thinks fit, direct a copy of the proclamation to be
published in a daily newspaper circulating in the place in which such person
ordinarily resides. (3) A statement in writing by the Court issuing the proclamation to
the effect that the proclamation was duly published on a specified day, in the manner
specified in clause (i) of sub-section (2), shall be conclusive evidence that the
requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the proclamation was
published on such day.
[(4) Where a proclamation published under sub-section (1) is in respect of a person accused of an
offence punishable under section 302, 304, 364, 367, 382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399,
400, 402, 436, 449, 459 or 460 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and such person fails to
appear at the specified place and time required by the proclamation, the Court may, after making
such inquiry as it thinks fit, pronounce him a proclaimed offender and make a declaration to that
effect.”
6. Let us now consider some of the pronouncements of this Court to appreciate its import.
6.1 In Kartarey v. State of U.P.8 the meaning of the word ‘absconder’ was recorded as follows:-
“43. …To be an “absconder” in the eye of law, it is not necessary that a person should
have run away from his home, it is sufficient if he hides himself to evade the process
of law, even if the hiding place be his own home…” Further, in Jayendra Vishnu
Thakur v. State of Maharashtra9, it was observed:-Daljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38030914/ 3

“40. The term “absconding” has been defined in several dictionaries. We may refer to
some of them:
Black's Law Dictionary — To depart secretly or suddenly, especially to avoid arrest,
prosecution or service of process. P. Ramanatha Aiyar — primary meaning of word is
“to hide”. Oxford English Dictionary — “To bide or sow away”. Words and Phrases —
“clandestine manner/intent to avoid legal process”.
(1976) 1 SCC 172 (2009) 7 SCC 104 6.2 The object and purpose of Section 82, Cr.P.C.
was taken note of in Vimlaben Ajitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel10. S.B
Sinha J., writing for the Court held as under:-
“32. The provisions contained in Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were
put on the statute book for certain purpose. It was enacted to secure the presence of
the accused. Once the said purpose is achieved, the attachment shall be withdrawn.
Even the property which was attached, should be restored. The provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure do not warrant sale of the property despite the fact that
the absconding accused had surrendered and obtained bail. Once he surrenders
before the court and the standing warrants are cancelled, he is no longer an
absconder. The purpose of attaching the property comes to an end. It is to be released
subject to the provisions of the Code. Securing the attendance of an absconding
accused, is a matter between the State and the accused. The complainant should not
ordinarily derive any benefit therefrom. If the property is to be sold, it vests with the
State subject to any order passed under Section 85 of the Code. It cannot be a
subject-matter of execution of a decree, far less for executing the decree of a third
party, who had no right, title or interest thereon.” (Emphasis Supplied) 6.3 The
evidentiary value of a person absconding has been discussed in Raghubir Singh v.
State of U.P.,11 in the following terms:
“11. …the act of absconding, even if proved, is normally considered a somewhat weak
link in the chain of circumstances utilised for establishing the guilt of an accused
person. If the evidence of eye- witnesses is held trustworthy then the act of
absconding even if established would serve only to further fortify the satisfaction of
the court with respect to the guilt of the accused concerned, for, even an innocent
person may well try to keep out of the way if he learns of his false implication in a
serious crime reported to the police. ...” (Emphasis Supplied) 6.4 In Rahman v. State
of U.P.,12 it was held that absconding by itself is not conclusive either of guilt or of a
guilty conscience. For, a person may (2008) 4 SCC 649 (1972) 3 SCC 79 AIR 1972 SC
110 abscond on account of fear of being involved in the offence or for any other allied
reason. The observations in Matru v. State of U.P.,13 are instructive.
“19. … Even an innocent man may feel panicky and try to evade arrest when wrongly suspected of a
grave crime such is the instinct of self-preservation. The act of absconding is no doubt relevant piece
of evidence to be considered along with other evidence but its value would always depend on theDaljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38030914/ 4

circumstances of each case. Normally the courts are disinclined to attach much importance to the
act of absconding, treating it as a very small item in the evidence for sustaining conviction. It can
scarcely be held as a determining link in completing the chain of circumstantial evidence which
must admit of no other reasonable hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused. …” (Emphasis
Supplied) 6.5 The notice under Section 41 Cr.P.C., must have necessarily been issued prior to the
notice and declaration under Section 82, and attachment under its subsequent sections. In State v.
Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar14, it was held: -
“22. … Now, the power of issuing a proclamation under Section 82 (quoted earlier)
can be exercised by a Court only in respect of a person “against whom a warrant has
been issued by it”. In other words, unless the Court issues a warrant the provisions of
Section 82, and the other sections that follow in that part, cannot be invoked in a
situation where in spite of its best efforts the police cannot arrest a person under
Section 41.” 6.6 Numerous judgments of this Court which concern this Section, have
been about bail. Illustratively, Sureshchandra Ramanlal v. State of Gujarat15, State of
M.P. v. Pradeep Sharma16, Prem Shankar Prasad v.
State of Bihar17 and Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar18. However, we (1971) 2 SCC 75 (2000) 10
SCC 438 (2008) 7 SCC 591 (2014) 2 SCC 171 (2022) 14 SCC 516 2024 SCC OnLine SC 282 are not
concerned with bail in the present matter, so it is not necessary to go into them.
7. Having considered the law as laid down in the judgments above in respect of Section 82, at this
stage we must also consider Section 174A IPC which lays down penal consequences for intentionally
evading the process under Section 82 Cr.P.C. It reads as under :-
“174A. Non-appearance in response to a proclamation under section 82 of Act 2 of
1974.— Whoever fails to appear at the specified place and the specified time as
required by a proclamation published under sub-section (1) of section 82 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which
may extend to three years or with fine or with both, and where a declaration has been
made under sub section (4) of that section pronouncing him as a proclaimed
offender, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
seven years and shall also be liable to fine.” Now, let us consider the second question
arising in this appeal, in reference to this provision is, whether the subsistence of the
proclamation u/s 82 Cr.PC is necessary for the authorities to proceed against the
accused person u/s 174A IPC.
In other words, whether Section 174A IPC can stand independent of the proclamation u/s 82 Cr.P.C.
or not?
7.1 The purpose of Section 82 Cr.P.C., as can be understood from a bare reading of the statutory text
is to ensure that a person who is called to appear before a Court, does so. This Section appears as
part of Chapter VI which is titled ‘Process to Compel Appearance’. Section 83 to 90 provide for the
additional method of attachment of property to the end of securing appearance. Necessarily thenDaljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38030914/ 5

some or the other proceeding has to be ongoing for which the presence of such person is necessary.
The words of the Section dictate that it can be only issued in respect of a person against whom a
warrant has been issued. Neither a warrant nor proclamation subsequent can be conjured up out of
thin air.
7.2 Section 174A IPC, inserted by the 2005 Amendment to the Indian Penal Code inserts a
substantive offence, prescribing punishment of three years or fine or both when such proclamation
is issued under Section 82(1) Cr.P.C. and, seven years and fine if the said proclamation is under Sub-
section (4) thereof. The object and purpose of this Section is to ensure penal consequences for
defiance of a Court order requiring a person’s presence. 7.3 Now, what happens if the status under
Section 82 Cr.P.C. is nullified i.e., the person subjected to such proclamation, by virtue of
subsequent developments is no longer required to be presented before a Court of law. Then, can the
prosecution still proceed against such a person for having not appeared before a Court during the
time that the process was in effect. The answer is in the affirmative. We say so for the following
reasons:-
(i) The language of Section 174A, IPC says “whoever fails to appear at the specified
place and the specified time as required by proclamation…”. This implies that the
very instance at which a person is directed to appear, and he does not do so, this
Section comes into play;
(ii) What further flows from the language employed is that the instance of
non-appearance becomes an infraction of the Section, and therefore, prosecution
therefor would be independent of Section 82, Cr.P.C. being in effect;
(iii) So, while proceedings under Section 174A IPC cannot be initiated independent of
Section 82, Cr.P.C., i.e., can only be started post the issuance of proclamation, they
can continue if the said proclamation is no longer in effect.
(iv) We find that the Delhi High Court has taken this view, i.e., that Section 174A, IPC
is a stand-alone offence in Mukesh Bhatia v.
State (NCT of Delhi)19; Divya Verma v. State20; Sameena & Anr. v. State GNCT of Delhi & Anr.21
For the reasons afore-stated, we agree with the findings made in these judgments/orders. At the
same time, it stands clarified that we have not commented on the merits of the cases.
(v) Granted that the offence prescribed in Section 174A IPC is indeed stand-alone, given that it
arises out of an original offence in connection with which proceedings under Section 82 Cr.P.C. is
initiated and in the said offence the accused stands, subsequently, acquitted, it would be permissible
in law for the Court seized of the trial under such offence, to take note of such a development and
treat the same as a ground to draw the proceedings to a close, should such a prayer be made and the
circumstances of the case so warrant.Daljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38030914/ 6

8. In conclusion, we hold that Section 174A IPC is an independent, substantive offence, that can
continue even if the proclamation under Section 82, Cr.P.C. is extinguished. It is a stand-alone
offence. That being the position of 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1023 2023 SCC OnLine Del 2619 Crl. M.C
No, 1470 of 2021, Dated 17th May, 2022 law, let us now turn to the present facts. As we have already
noted supra, the Appellant stands acquitted of the main offence.
9. The record speaks to the fact that an FIR under Section 174A IPC was registered against the
Appellant, in connection with which, he was released on bail by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class,
Bhiwani, vide order dated 19th December, 2022. It reads: -
“Dinesh Kumar Vs. R.P. Singh etc. BA-3034-2022 COMA-1664-2013 Present:
Complainant in person with Sh. Raj kumar Gugnani, Advocate.
Sh. Devender Singh Tanwar, counsel for the accused Daljeet Singh. Reply to the bail
application not filed. Brief arguments on the bail application heard. At this juncture a
compromise has been effected wherein the matter has been settled for 9.5 lakh out of
which Rs. 1 lakh have been paid to the complainant and another Rs. 1 lakh shall Be
transferred in his bank account today. The nephew and son of the accused have
further suffered a statement that the remaining 7.5 lakh shall be paid to the
complainant on or before the adjourned date of hearing. The complainant have
suffered a statement and agrees with the said arrangement. In the given
circumstances when the matter has been settled and even otherwise also the
proceedings had been stayed by Hon'ble High court way back on 07.02.2017 and
which have only been dismissed on 15.11.2022 after which, the accused was arrested
on 17.12.2022. he is admitted to bail subject to the following conditions.
1. He shall furnish personal and surety bonds in the sum of Rs.50,000/-along with an
FDR In the sum of Rs. 50,000/-
2. The present place of residence as well as office of the accused be furnished by way
of affidavit through next of kin.
3. That he shall come present in Court in person on all dates of hearing, failing which
his bail shall be cancelled, subject to just exceptions.
Requisite bonds, affidavit and FDR furnished. Accepted and atlested. Additional affidavit also filed
by surety that he shall not en cash the FDR without the permission of the Court and that the R.C.
submitted is original which he shall not sell without the permission of The Court Release Warrant be
issued forth with. Adjourned to 21.01.2023 for payment else for further proceedings.” (emphasis
supplied)
10. None has disputed the above or brought to the attention of this Court such a fact that the said
arrangement has not been complied with.Daljit Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38030914/ 7

11. The Appellant has been acquitted which means that there is no case for which his presence is
required to be secured. Resultantly, the appeal is allowed. In the attending facts and circumstances
of the case, i.e. that the original offence pertains to the year 2010; the money subject matter of
dispute stands paid, the judgment of the High Court with the particulars as mentioned in paragraph
1 of this judgment, stands quashed and set aside. All criminal proceedings, inclusive of the FIR
under Section 174A IPC, shall stand closed. The Appellant’s status, as a ‘proclaimed person’ stands
quashed.
Pending Application(s) if any, stand disposed of.
