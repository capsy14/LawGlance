Delay condoned.
Leave Granted.
2. This appeal is at the instance of the claimant-appellant, who is aggrieved by the order and
judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in FAO No.4651 of 2014 (O&M)
dated 9 th January, 2020. The appeal before the High Court was drawn against the judgment and
order dated Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Gurgaon, in MACT Case No.3 of 8 th January, 2013,
passed on 25th September, 20131.
1 Hereafter, “MACT”
3. The facts giving rise to the present appeal are as follows:-
On 12th October 2012, the claimant-appellant namely, Deepak along with his friendDeepak Singh Alias Deepak Chauhan vs Mukesh Kumar on 10 February, 2025

Bhagwan Singh were riding a motorcycle bearing No.HR-26-AJ- 5496, being driven
by the latter, heading to Kulana, when they collided with a Scorpio, which was being
driven at a fast pace, rashly and negligently, from the wrong side.
Bhagwan Singh succumbed to the injuries on the spot while the claimant- appellant
suffered grievous injuries. FIR No.213 under Sections 279, 337, 304- A and 427 of the
Indian Penal Code, dated 13th October, 2012, was registered.
The Claimant-Appellant filed the claim petition on 7th January, 2013.
4. The learned MACT framed four issues for consideration, concerning the rashness and negligence
of respondent No.1; entitlement of the claimant- appellant to compensation; liability of respondent
No.3-insurer, to pay compensation; and the validity of the respondent’s driving license.
Having considered the evidence before it, the conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal is as below : -
“ Relief :
24. In view of findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, the
petition is partly allowed with costs. A sum of Rs.7,09,303/- is awarded as
compensation to the petitioner along with interest @7.5% per annum from the date
of filing of the petition till realization, out of which 50% shall, however, be paid to
him in cash but the same shall be deposited in his bank account and remaining 50%
shall be deposited for three years in fixed deposit account of any nationalized bank.
25. All the respondents being driver, owner and insurer of the offending vehicle are
jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimants.
However, respondent No.3 insurance company being the main stakeholder would pay
the entire amount of compensation to the claimant.
26. Lawyer's fee is assessed at Rs.11,000/-. Memo of cost be prepared accordingly
and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.” (Emphasis supplied)
5. Feeling dissatisfied and aggrieved by the compensation awarded, the claimant-appellant appealed
before the High Court. A perusal of the impugned judgment reveals that the Court relied on a
judgment of this Court in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar2 and the testimony of Dr. Arvind Mehra - PW6,
along with the discharge summary(s). The total compensation as enhanced by the Court was
Rs.23,90,719/- and the interest part remained undisturbed.
6. Further aggrieved, an appeal has been preferred before us. In advancing arguments, learned
counsel for the claimant-appellant took issue with the High Court’s reliance on minimum wages to
calculate compensation. This, he did while placing reliance on an order dated 13 th January, 2020 of
this Court passed in Civil Appeal No.278 of 2020 titled Navjot Singh v. Harpreet Singh. We find
force in this submission of the claimant-appellant.Deepak Singh Alias Deepak Chauhan vs Mukesh Kumar on 10 February, 2025

7. While dealing with the claim of compensation of a similarly placed individual, i.e., a student in his
twenties, this Court in Harpreet Singh (supra) 2 (2011) 1 SCC 343 took exception to equating the
notional income of an Engineering student to that of an unskilled worker the following terms -
“13. But we do not think that the notional income of a student undergoing a Degree course in
Engineering from a premier institute should be taken to be equivalent to the minimum wages
admissible to an unskilled worker. Students recruited through campus interviews are atleast offered
a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month. Even if we do not go on the said basis, the High Court could have
fixed the notional income atleast at Rs.10,000/- per month.
14. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, and by exercising our power under Article
142 of the Constitution of India, we take the notional monthly income of the appellant as Rs.10,000/
per month.”
8. In the present facts, the accident took place in the year 2012. Hence, reliance can be placed on
Harpreet Singh (supra). In the attending facts, taking the notional income to be Rs.10,000/- per
month, the compensation to be awarded would be recomputed in the following terms :-
