Equivalent citations: 1996 AIR 3012, 1996 4 SCR 665, (1996) 10 SCC 715

PETITIONER: SEBI

Vs. KETAN DALAL & ORS

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 12/12/1996

BENCH: S.C. Agrawal, G.N. Ray

ACT: SEBI Act; Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act; irregular
securities transactions — forged Bank Receipts — 1992 Harshad Mehta
securities scam.

HEADNOTE: Securities scam — respondents accused of facilitating
irregular ready‑forward deals involving forged Bank Receipts (BRs),
enabling diversion of funds used by brokers associated with Harshad
Mehta.

Inspection reports revealed mismatched BR numbers, nonexistent
securities underlying several transactions, and false entries in bank
ledgers. Respondents argued they merely acted as intermediaries and did
not benefit monetarily. SEBI maintained strict liability applies in
market‑manipulation cases.

JUDGMENT: 1. Forged BRs undermine financial market integrity. 2. Mens
rea irrelevant for violations under SEBI regulatory framework. 3.
Documentary evidence proved participation in irregular transactions. 4.
Penalty proportionate given market impact.

ORDER: Licenses suspended for 3 years. Monetary penalty affirmed.
