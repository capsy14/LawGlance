CITATOR INFO: R 1987 SC 554 (21) RF 1994 SC 911 (9)

ACT: Indian Penal Code, 1860 — Sections 378, 379 (Theft) Whether
recovery of stolen goods solely on the basis of disclosure statement is
sufficient for conviction— Effect of unexplained delay in lodging FIR—
Scope of Supreme Court’s interference in concurrent findings of fact by
trial court and High Court.

HEADNOTE: Criminal law—Theft—Appreciation of evidence—The petitioner was
alleged to have stolen several gold ornaments from the residence of one
Smt. Kamla Devi on the night of 4 March 1983. The prosecution relied
primarily on (i) recovery of ornaments from a field allegedly shown by
the accused, (ii) testimony of neighbours claiming to have seen him near
the house, and (iii) a delayed FIR filed 36 hours after the incident.

The Trial Court convicted the petitioner under Section 379 IPC. The High
Court affirmed the conviction, holding that recovery under Section 27 of
the Evidence Act was sufficient.

In appeal to the Supreme Court, it was argued that the recovery was
fabricated and that the unexplained delay in filing FIR vitiated the
prosecution case.

Allowing the appeal, the Court held that mere recovery without
independent corroboration cannot form the sole basis for conviction when
surrounding circumstances raise doubt. The Court also noted that the
unexplained delay in reporting the theft weakened the prosecution story.

The conviction was set aside.

JUDGMENT:

SEN, A.P.

1.  This appeal, by special leave, is directed against the judgment
    dated 12 July 1984 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court affirming the
    conviction of the appellant, Ramesh Verma, under Section 379 IPC and
    the sentence of one year’s rigorous imprisonment.

2.  The prosecution case, in brief, is that on the night of 4 March
    1983, several gold ornaments were stolen from the residence of Smt.
    Kamla Devi. The FIR was lodged on 6 March 1983, nearly 36 hours
    after the alleged incident. The complainant attributed the delay to
    “consultation with family members,” though no evidence was led to
    substantiate the claim.

3.  The appellant was arrested on 10 March 1983. According to the
    prosecution, he made a disclosure statement which led to the
    recovery of certain gold ornaments from an open field near
    Chandrasagar village.

4.  The Trial Court placed reliance solely on the recovery and the
    testimony of two neighbours who claimed to have seen the appellant
    near the house, though both admitted in their cross-examination that
    the area is frequented by many villagers.

5.  The High Court affirmed the conviction, holding the recovery
    sufficient.

6.  The question for consideration is whether the conviction can be
    sustained solely on such evidence.

7.  It is well settled that recovery under Section 27 of the Evidence
    Act, though admissible, cannot by itself prove guilt unless
    supported by trustworthy evidence. This Court has consistently held
    that recovery from an open place accessible to all is a weak type of
    evidence.

8.  In the present case, the alleged recovery was from an unfenced field
    accessible to many. No independent witness supported the
    prosecution’s claim that the appellant alone knew the location.
    Further, the FIR delay remains wholly unexplained, raising serious
    doubts about the prosecution narrative.

9.  On a careful review of the material, we are unable to sustain the
    conviction. The appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt.

10. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The conviction and sentence are
    set aside. The appellant is acquitted.

PATHAK, R.S. — I agree.
