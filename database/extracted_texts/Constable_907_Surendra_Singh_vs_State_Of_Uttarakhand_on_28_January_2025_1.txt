B.R. GAVAI, J.
1. These appeals challenge the judgment and final order dated 27th December 2012 passed by the
High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital by which the High Court dealt with three Criminal Appeals
which had been filed challenging the judgment and order dated 6th September 2006 passed by the
learned Sessions Judge, Dehradun1. The first set of appeals before the High Court being Criminal
Appeal Nos. 217 of 2006 and 218 of 2006 challenging the judgment and order of the trial court had
been preferred by accused No.1-Jagdish Singh by which he had been convicted for the offence
punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 18602 and Section
27(1) of the Arms Act, 19593 and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. The second set of
appeal being Government Appeal No. 100 of 2008 before the High Court was filed by the
respondent-State of Uttarakhand against the present appellants namely, Constable 907 SurendraConstable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025

Singh, Constable 192 Surat Singh and Ashad Singh Negi (accused Nos. 4, 2 and 3 respectively)
challenging the said judgment of the trial court by which they had been acquitted of the charges
under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
2. The High Court dismissed the first set of criminal appeals preferred by accused No.1-Jagdish
Singh thereby confirming the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by Hereinafter
referred to as the ‘trial court’. 2 For short ‘IPC’.
3 For short ‘Arms Act’ the trial court. However, the High Court allowed the Government Appeal
preferred by the respondent-State of Uttarakhand and set aside the order of acquittal qua the
appellants herein and convicted them for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with
Section 34 of the IPC and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life. Aggrieved by the same,
the present appeals have been filed by the appellants herein.
3. Shorn of details, the facts which lead to the present appeals are as follows:-
3.1 On 15th November 2004, the SHO of the Police Station, Rishikesh received
information that illegal liquor was being smuggled in a Maruti Car bearing
registration No. DL2CR4766.
On receipt of such information, at about 8:55 p.m., Head Constable of the Police Station Jagdish
Singh along with the other accused-appellants Constable Surendra Singh, Constable Surat Singh
and Constable Driver Ashad Singh set out in a silver-coloured Indica car to intercept the
aforementioned Maruti car. At around 8:30 p.m., the police personnel spotted a Maruti car near
IDPL Gate. Constable Ashad Singh, who was driving the car, and Head Constable Jagdish Singh
attempted to stop the car by overtaking it and indicating to the driver of the Maruti car to halt.
However, when the driver of the Maruti car failed to stop his car, Head Constable Jagdish Singh
fired a single shot from 0.38 bore revolver that he was carrying with himself. The said shot hit the
co-passenger seated in the front seat of the Maruti car in her temporal region, eventually leading to
her death. 3.2 As a corollary to this incident, on 16th November 2004, one Sanjeev Chauhan lodged
a written complaint at Police Station, Rishikesh. According to the complaint, the complainant was
driving down from Roorkee to Rishikesh in his Maruti car on 15th November 2004. He was in the
driving seat while his wife Manisha (hereinafter referred to as ‘the deceased’) was sitting in the front
passenger seat and his sister Km. Bharti and his daughter Km. Bhumika were sitting in the rear
seats. Having started at around 6:45 p.m. from Roorkee, their car crossed Shyampur Railway
Crossing which was close to IDPL gate at about 8:30 p.m. when a silver-coloured Indica car without
a registration plate overtook the car of the complainant. The occupants of the Indica car who were
dressed in police uniforms, indicated to the complainant to stop his car. However, when the
complainant failed to comply, a bullet came to be fired by one of the occupants of the Indica car. The
said bullet hit the wife of the complainant on her temporal region. Upon the occurrence of the
incident, a crowd gathered at the spot and the complainant was informed by the onlookers that one
of the occupants of the Indica car was Jagdish Singh who was posted as Head Constable at Police
Station, Rishikesh. With the aid of the assembled bystanders, the complainant took his wife to
Government Hospital, Rishikesh, where she was declared ‘brought dead’. 3.3 Thereafter, theConstable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 2

complainant went to lodge a complaint at Police Station Kotwali, Rishikesh where he saw the Indica
car parked within the premises of the Police Station. He telephoned his brother Rajeev who arrived
at the Police Station with their uncles Jugal Kishore and Vijay Chauhan. On the basis of the
complaint dictated by the complainant and scribed by Vijay Chauhan, a First Information Report
being Case Crime No. 455 of 2004 was registered at the aforesaid Police Station against Head
Constable Jagdish Singh and other unknown police constables for the offence punishable under
Section 302 of the IPC.
3.4 The dead body of the deceased was sent for a post- mortem and according to the Post-Mortem
Report the cause of death was cranio-cerebral damage following a bullet injury. 3.5 Upon the
conclusion of the investigation and on receiving permission from the S.S.P., Dehradun to prosecute
the accused persons, a charge sheet (Ext. Ka-27) was preferred against the four accused persons for
the offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. A separate charge sheet
(Ext. Ka-28) was preferred against Head Constable Jagdish Singh for the offence punishable under
Section 27(3) of the Arms Act.
3.6 As the case was exclusively triable by the Sessions Court, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Dehradun committed the case of the four accused persons to the trial court, leading to the
registration of S.T. No. 50 of 2005. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dehradun further
committed the case of accused No.1-Jagdish Singh qua the separate charge sheet before the trial
court, leading to the registration of S.T. 108 of 2005. Both the aforementioned Sessions Trials were
consolidated and numbered as S.T. No. 50 of 2005. 3.7 At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court
convicted accused No.1-Jagdish Singh as aforementioned and sentenced him to imprisonment for
life while acquitting the three other accused-appellants since the prosecution had failed to prove the
case beyond reasonable doubt insofar as they were concerned.
3.8 Being aggrieved thereby, accused No.1-Jagdish Singh preferred two criminal appeals before the
High Court against the order of his conviction and sentence. The respondent-State also preferred a
criminal appeal before the High Court against the acquittal of the other accused-appellants. 3.9 The
High Court by the impugned judgment dismissed the criminal appeals preferred by accused
No.1-Jagdish Singh and allowed the criminal appeal preferred by the respondent-State of
Uttarakhand.
3.10 Being aggrieved thereby three Criminal Appeals under Section 379 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 19734 came to be filed before this Court. Criminal Appeal No. 355 of 2013 was filed by
Constable 907 Surendra Singh and Constable 192 4 For short ‘Cr.P.C.’ Surat Singh. Criminal Appeal
No. 788 of 2013 was filed by Ashad Singh Negi. Finally, Criminal Appeal Nos. 1425-1426 of 2015
were filed by Head Constable Jagdish Singh.
4. This Court by order dated 15th July 2013 admitted Criminal Appeal Nos. 355 of 2013 and 788 of
2013 and granted bail to the appellants in both the appeals.
5. During the hearing of the appeals, we were informed that Head Constable Jagdish Singh had
passed away. Accordingly, on 16th January 2025 Criminal Appeal Nos. 1425-1426 of 2015, preferredConstable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 3

by him, were disposed of as abated.
6. We have heard Mr. Devadatt Kamat, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants
and Mr. Rajeev Kumar Dubey, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent-State.
7. Mr. Devadatt Kamat submits that the Division Bench of the High Court has grossly erred in
convicting the appellants with the aid of Section 34 of the IPC. It is submitted that the learned trial
judge on an elaborate consideration of the evidence had come to a considered opinion that insofar as
the present appellants are concerned there is no evidence to show that the present appellants had
shared a common intention with the accused No.1-Jagdish Singh. It is submitted that the allegation
of alleged assault made by Sanjeev Chauhan, PW-1 (husband of the deceased) and Km. Bharti, PW-2
(sister-in-law of the deceased) in their evidence for the first time before the Court cannot be relied
on. Insofar as the said alleged assault is concerned, it is submitted that though the said incident has
taken place in public, no independent witness has been examined by the prosecution. Learned
Senior Counsel relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of Gadadhar Chandra v. State of
West Bengal5 in support of his submissions.
8. It is further submitted that the interference in the judgment of acquittal by the learned trial judge
would have been warranted by the High Court only in the event the view taken by the learned trial
judge was found to be perverse or impossible. It is submitted that no perversity or impossibility
could be noticed in the view taken by the learned trial judge and as such the interference by the High
Court in an appeal against the acquittal was totally unwarranted. 5 (2022) 6 SCC 576
9. As against this, the learned counsel for the respondent- State submits that the Division Bench of
the High Court has given sound reasons for reversing the order of acquittal and as such no
interference is warranted in the present appeals.
10. We have perused the entire material on record with the assistance of the learned counsel for the
parties.
11. Recently, in the case of Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar and others v. State of Karnataka6, a
Bench of this Court to which one of us was a Member (B.R. Gavai, J.) had an occasion to consider
the legal position with regard to the scope of interference in an appeal against acquittal. It was
observed thus:
“38. First of all, we would like to reiterate the principles laid down by this Court
governing the scope of interference by the High Court in an appeal filed by the State
for challenging acquittal of the accused recorded by the trial court.
39. This Court in Rajesh Prasad v. State of Bihar [Rajesh Prasad v. State of Bihar,
(2022) 3 SCC 471 : (2022) 2 SCC (Cri) 31] encapsulated the legal position covering
the field after considering various earlier judgments and held as below : (SCC pp.Constable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 4

482-83, para 29) 6 (2024) 8 SCC 149 “29. After referring to a catena of judgments, this Court culled
out the following general principles regarding the powers of the appellate court while dealing with
an appeal against an order of acquittal in the following words :
(Chandrappa case [Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka, (2007) 4 SCC 415 :
(2007) 2 SCC (Cri) 325] , SCC p.
432, para 42) ‘42. From the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general principles
regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal
emerge:
(1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the
evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.
          (2) The Criminal
          Procedure      Code,
          1973      puts   no
          limitation,
          restriction       or
          condition        on
          exercise of such
power     and    an
appellate court on
the        evidence
before it may reach
its             own
conclusion, both
on questions of
fact and of law.
(3)         Various
expressions, such
as,    “substantial
and      compelling
reasons”,     “good
and       sufficient
grounds”,      “very
strong
circumstances”,
“distorted
conclusions”,
“glaring mistakes”,
etc.     are     not
intended to curtail
extensive powers
of an appellateConstable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 5

court in an appeal
against acquittal.
Such
phraseologies are
more in the nature
of “flourishes of
language”         to
emphasise        the
reluctance of an
appellate court to
interfere       with
acquittal than to
curtail the power
of the court to
review           the
evidence and to
come to its own
conclusion.
(4) An appellate
court,     however,
must bear in mind
that in case of
acquittal, there is
double
presumption        in
favour     of     the
accused. Firstly,
the presumption of
innocence           is
available to him
under             the
fundamental
principle          of
criminal
jurisprudence that
every person shall
be presumed to be
innocent unless he
is proved guilty by
a competent court
of law. Secondly,
the         accused
having secured his
acquittal,        the
presumption of his
innocence           is
further reinforced,
reaffirmed       and
strengthened       by
the trial court.Constable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 6

(5)     If       two
reasonable
conclusions       are
possible on       the
basis     of      the
                evidence         on
                record,         the
                appellate     court
                should not disturb
                the    finding    of
                acquittal recorded
                by      the    trial
                court.’ ”
40. Further, in H.D. Sundara v. State of Karnataka [H.D. Sundara v. State of
Karnataka, (2023) 9 SCC 581: (2023) 3 SCC (Cri) 748] this Court summarised the
principles governing the exercise of appellate jurisdiction while dealing with an
appeal against acquittal under Section 378CrPC as follows : (SCC p. 584, para 8) “8.
… 8.1. The acquittal of the accused further strengthens the presumption of innocence;
8.2. The appellate court, while hearing an appeal against acquittal, is entitled to reappreciate the
oral and documentary evidence;
8.3. The appellate court, while deciding an appeal against acquittal, after reappreciating the
evidence, is required to consider whether the view taken by the trial court is a possible view which
could have been taken on the basis of the evidence on record;
8.4. If the view taken is a possible view, the appellate court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on
the ground that another view was also possible; and 8.5. The appellate court can interfere with the
order of acquittal only if it comes to a finding that the only conclusion which can be recorded on the
basis of the evidence on record was that the guilt of the accused was proved beyond a reasonable
doubt and no other conclusion was possible.”
41. Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the scope of interference by an appellate court for
reversing the judgment of acquittal recorded by the trial court in favour of the accused has to be
exercised within the four corners of the following principles:
41.1. That the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity;
41.2. That the same is based on a misreading/omission to consider material evidence
on record; and 41.3. That no two reasonable views are possible and only the view
consistent with the guilt of the accused is possible from the evidence available on
record.”Constable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 7

12. It could thus be seen that it is a settled legal position that the interference with the
finding of acquittal recorded by the learned trial judge would be warranted by the
High Court only if the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity; that the
same is based on a misreading/omission to consider material evidence on record;
and that no two reasonable views are possible and only the view consistent with the
guilt of the accused is possible from the evidence available on record.
13. In the instant case, the learned trial judge on the basis of ocular testimony of the
eyewitnesses has held that the accused No.1-Jagdish Singh is guilty of the offence
punishable under Section 302/34 IPC as well as under Section 27(1) of the Arms Act.
Since the appeal of the said accused No.1-Jadgish Singh is disposed of as abated, we
did not go into the findings against the said accused.
14. The learned trial judge while recording the finding of acquittal insofar as the
present appellants are concerned, has come to the following conclusions:
(i) That these three accused (appellants herein) were in the car and the accused
No.1-Jagdish Singh was senior to them, and that they were under the command of
their senior officer;
(ii) Accused Ashad Singh had admitted this aspect and had stated that he was driving
the car under the orders of his superior officer;
(iii) The remaining two accused had raised a plea of alibi, which was based on certain
entries in the General Diary (G.D.)
(iv) That accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4 (the appellants herein) were not named in the
report;
(v) From the evidence of Rajendra Singh Nagarkoti, P.W.9 as well as identification
memo Exhibit Ka-13 prepared by the Executive Magistrate Bishan Singh Bisht, it was
clear that only one accused, namely, Ashad Singh could be identified and that too
only by one witness i.e. by P.W.1;
(vi) That the identification of the accused by only one witness was not sufficient to
come to a conclusion of guilt against the accused.
15. Upon consideration of these factors, the learned trial judge came to a conclusion that even if it
was assumed that the remaining three accused had accompanied accused No.1- Jagdish Singh, there
was no evidence to come to a conclusion that accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4 (the appellants herein) who
were in car with accused No.1-Jagdish Singh had shared a common intention with him to fire upon
or to kill the deceased.Constable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/191647839/ 8

16. The learned trial judge, therefore, found that the prosecution had failed to prove the mental
involvement of accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4 (the appellants herein) with accused No.1-Jagdish Singh
beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt.
17. However, this well-reasoned finding of the learned trial court has been upset by the High Court
on the ground that the remaining three accused were sitting in the same vehicle along with accused
No.1-Jagdish Kumar was sufficient to convict them with the aid of Section 34 of the IPC.
18. By now it is a settled principle of law that for convicting the accused with the aid of Section 34 of
the IPC the prosecution must establish prior meetings of minds. It must be established that all the
accused had preplanned and shared a common intention to commit the crime with the accused who
has actually committed the crime. It must be established that the criminal act has been done in
furtherance of the common intention of all the accused. Reliance in support of the aforesaid
proposition could be placed on the following judgments of this Court in the cases of:
(i) Ezajhussain Sabdarhussain and another v.
State of Gujarat7;
(ii) Jasdeep Singh alias Jassu v. State of Punjab8;
(iii) Gadadhar Chandra v. State of West Bengal (supra); and
(iv) Madhusudan and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh9.
19. In the present case, as observed by the learned trial judge, the prosecution has failed to place on
record any evidence to show that the accused Nos. 2, 3 and 4 (the appellants herein) had common
intention with accused No.1-Jagdish Singh prior to the accused No.1-Jagdish Singh’s shooting at the
deceased resulting in her death.
20. In the result, we pass the following order:
      (i)     The appeals are allowed.
      (ii)    The judgment and order of the High Court of
Uttarakhand at Nainital in Government Appeal No. 100 of 2008 is quashed and aside.
7 (2019) 14 SCC 339 8 (2022) 2 SCC 545 9 2024 SCC OnLine SC 4035
(iii) The judgment and order dated 6th September 2006 passed by the learned Sessions Judge,
Dehradun in Sessions Trial No.50 of 2005 is affirmed.
(iv) The appellants herein are on bail. Their bail bonds shall stand discharged.Constable 907 Surendra Singh vs State Of Uttarakhand on 28 January, 2025
