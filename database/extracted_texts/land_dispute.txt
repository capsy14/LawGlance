COURT 2210, 1994 3 SCR 812, (1994) 6 SCC 157

PETITIONER: SHIV PRATAP SINGH

Vs. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 19/07/1994

BENCH: B.P. Jeevan Reddy, M.N. Venkatachaliah

ACT: Land Acquisition Act, 1894 — Sections 4, 5A, 6 — Whether
acquisition for an industrial estate without proper service of notice
violates natural justice and renders proceedings void.

HEADNOTE: Land dispute — validity of compulsory acquisition — procedural
irregularity — non‑service of Section 5A hearing notices — fabricated
public hearing records — arbitrary exercise of State authority — burden
of proof lies on acquiring authority.

The petitioner owned 6.2 acres of fertile agricultural land in Etawah
district, inherited over three generations. A Section 4 notification
dated 10 April 1990 was issued to acquire land for the “Etawah
Industrial Development Project.” Petitioner claimed that no notice was
ever served, and local revenue officers falsely recorded that objections
were heard.

Trial Court dismissed the writ citing “presumption of correctness of
government records.” High Court upheld it without independently
verifying service of notice.

Supreme Court held that failure to provide reasonable opportunity under
Section 5A violates natural justice. No evidence was produced proving
service of notice; signatures in the hearing register appeared forged.
State acted mechanically and failed to justify urgency.

JUDGMENT: 1. Petitioner asserts that land was taken without notice. 2.
Revenue authorities claim they served notice, but no receipts or
signatures from petitioner produced. 3. The Section 5A hearing register
contained overwriting, unmatched signatures, and inconsistent
timestamps. 4. The State failed to justify urgency clause invocation
under Section 17, which was added later without reasons. 5. Acquisition
was declared unlawful and quashed.

ORDER: Section 6 declaration struck down. Land restored to petitioner.
All consequential actions cancelled.
