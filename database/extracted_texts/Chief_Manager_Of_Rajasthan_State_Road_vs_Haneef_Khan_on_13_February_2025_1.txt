                                                           O R D E R
The application for amendment is allowed. Permission is granted to assail the order dated
11.07.2022 passed in D.B. Civil Review Petition No.263/2019.
Leave granted.
2. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant- Corporation and learned counsel for the
respondent at length.
3. During the course of submission, while narrating the facts of the case in detail, learned counsel for
the appellant submitted that initially, the High Court while disposing of the D.B. Special Appeal
Writ No.310/2018 connected with D.B. Special Appeal Writ No.819/2018, the latter filed by the
appellant herein by judgment dated 12.02.2019 had ordered that only 50% of the back wages (half
the back wages) by way of actual monetary benefit along with continuity of service for the
intervening period from 04.10.2001 to 30.11.2010 with interest at 9% per annum may be awarded to
the respondent Reason: herein, within a time-frame of three months which was also indicated for
compliance. Consequently, the appeal filed by the appellant herein was dismissed by the High court.
However, respondent herein had preferred D.B. Civil Review Petition No.263/2019 seeking full back
wages for the aforesaid period. By order dated 11.07.2022, the said Review Petition was allowed and
the Division Bench directed that the respondent herein was entitled to full wages in respect of the
intervening period under the order of termination dated 04.10.2001 i.e. the intervening period from
04.10.2001 dated 30.11.2010.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant has a good case on merits and in
fact the order rejecting the permission under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
by the Labour Court and subsequently, the same being sustained by the High Court are contrary to
law. Alternatively, she submitted that in the event, this Court is not inclined to interfere in theChief Manager Of Rajasthan State Road ... vs Haneef Khan on 13 February, 2025

matter on merits, at least, the order of the Division Bench dated 12.02.2019 may be given effect to
and the order passed in the Review Petition dated 11.07.2022 may be set aside.
5. Learned counsel for the respondent however contended that there is no merit in this appeal; that
the High Court was justified in allowing the Review Petition and granting full back wages and hence,
the appeal may be dismissed.
6. We have considered the arguments advanced at the bar in light of the fact that this appeal has had
a checkered history and we note that on the Labour Court rejecting the permission sought for by the
appellant herein, there was deemed continuation of employment of the respondent and therefore,
the High Court has rightly observed that in the absence of any other intervening factor, the appellant
was entitled to back wages on the premise that there was continuity in service of the respondent
herein.
7. In our view, the High Court was justified in granting only 50% of the back wages by its initial
order dated 12.02.2019. However, in the Review Petition the said order has been modified to grant
full back wages which we find is not just and proper having regard to the facts and circumstances of
this case and particularly having regard to the fact that for nearly ten years the respondent herein,
without performing any of his duties, cannot at the same time seek full back wages.
8. We therefore set aside the order passed in the Review Petition dated 11.07.2022 and allow the
appeal in that regard and sustain the order passed by the Division Bench dated 12.02.2019 in D.B.
Special Appeal Writ No.310/2018 connected with D.B. Special Appeal Writ No.819/2018.
9. Since the respondent has in the interregnum attained the age of superannuation, the
appellant-Corporation shall comply with the directions of the High Court in D.B. Special Appeal
Writ No.310/2018 dated 12.02.2019 and grant all monetary benefits that the respondent is entitled
to owing to his superannuation, if any, within a period of one month from today.
These appeals are allowed in part in the aforesaid terms.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
