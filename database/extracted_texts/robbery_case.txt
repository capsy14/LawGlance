PETITIONER: NAVEEN YADAV

Vs. STATE OF HARYANA

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 03/03/1999

BENCH: K.T. Thomas, S.P. Bharucha

ACT: Indian Penal Code — Sections 392, 394 — identification parade —
evidentiary value of CCTV footage.

HEADNOTE: Robbery — petrol pump holdup — accused allegedly assaulted
cashier and escaped with ₹1,75,000. Identification parade was conducted
after 45 days, raising suspicion. CCTV footage was blurred and captured
only silhouettes.

Prosecution relied heavily on cashier’s testimony, who identified the
accused only after seeing him in police custody. Medical evidence
confirmed injuries but did not establish identity of assailant.

JUDGMENT: 1. Delay in TIP vitiates reliability. 2. CCTV footage
insufficient to identify accused. 3. Motive not proven; no recovery of
stolen money. 4. Prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.

ORDER: Appeal allowed. Accused acquitted.
